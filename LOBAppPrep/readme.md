>Notes:
>1. Make sure that the DmgtoIntunemac.sh shell script is located in the same directory as the Intune App Wrapping Tool (IntuneAppUtil) found at https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-mac. The name of this directory when downloaded from Microsoft is: intune-app-wrapping-tool-mac-master.
